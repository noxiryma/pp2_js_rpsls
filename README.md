### Colour Scheme

### Font 

The font family used for this site is 

"Montserrat Alternates", sans-serif; 

![Montserrat Alternates 400 screenshot](assets/images/readme-images/montserrat-400.jpg)

with a weight of 400 for the main content and a weight of 700 for the title header. Used to imply a logo for the site and give a clear heading.

The font was chosen for it’s accessibility as well as it’s design. The text is clear to read and has a more rounded style creating a smooth and relaxing experience for the user whilst they read and learn new information on the subject of meditation.
